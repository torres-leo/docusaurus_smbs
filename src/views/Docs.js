          We will assume that you have finished the guides, and know the basics
          like how to configure plugins, how to write React components, etc.
          These sections will have plugin authors and code contributors in mind,
          so we may occasionally refer to plugin APIs or other architecture
          details. Don't panic if you don't understand everythingðŸ˜‰
